# Ambulance Management System 

This is a C++ project developed for the **Data Structures and Algorithms** course. It simulates the management of ambulance services across multiple hospitals using a variety of data structures and calculates relevant performance statistics.

## Key Features

- **Two Execution Modes**:
  - **Interactive Mode**: Shows detailed hospital and patient data at each time step.
  - **Silent Mode**: Runs automatically and generates an output file with the results.

## Project Goals

- Simulate real-time hospital-ambulance interactions.
- Practice core data structure implementations.
- Analyze performance and behavior through statistics.
